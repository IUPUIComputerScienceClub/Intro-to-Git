# Intro to Git
This is a quick introduction on how to use git and GitHub to manage your projects. This is not a 100% the best way to use git - just what has worked for me. The topics that will be covered are:

* What is Git/GitHub?
  * Why Use Source Control?
  * Git vs. GitHub
* Installation
* My Workflow & Common Commands
* Tips & Tricks
* Jumping Off Points


## What is Git/GitHub?
It's important to understand what *Git* (the source-control program that runs on your computer) and *GitHub* really are. A lot of people jump right in without really understanding what they're doing, and then get stuck when they get into a situation that is messy. It's better to understand it from the start so that you don't get stuck in the first place, or if you do get stuck, you know how to get yourself out of a sticky situation!

### Why Use Source Control?
Source Control is an important tool in a programmer's toolkit. Source Control is really important in team projects, but I even use it in solo projects as it is a great way to help keep things organized, make sure that my code is backed-up, and have a way to roll back my code when I get into trouble. It is arguaby *essential* for code collaboration with a group/team of people, as it helps to structure how and what parts people are working on and section off the code base (if used correctly). For instance, I use *branching* a lot with my projects as it allows me to separate components of the code. I also use it to assign to members of a team - a branch for every team member - so that they can keep their code backed up and solve any problems they may be having in their own section of the code before adding it or merging it into the code base.

These aren't the only reasons to use it, but it's enough for me! Let's talk about what *Git* and *GitHub* really are.

### Git vs. GitHub
*Git* usually refers to the actual source control program that runs on your computer. When you install Git, this is installing the program into your computer so that you can access and run the program (usually through the command line). This is just like any other program you might install on your computer - it has features/funcionality that you wish to use.

Git itself is by default useable from the command line/terminal. One way to see all of the things you can do with git is to:

1. Open up the terminal on your computer, with git installed.
2. Run the command `git` in terminal (just type it into the terminal):

There's a bunch of other tools you can use (which we'll discuss) that can help you utilize Git. For instance, GitHub isn't actually a required part of Git - it's just an publicly available service provided by Microsoft that allows you to remotely store your source control, collaborate with a team, and manage certain aspects of your git repo. It's built *around* Git, not an actual component of Git. However, you'll find that it's extremely useful and complements a lot of Git's funcitonality.
